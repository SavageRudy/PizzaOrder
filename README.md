Project 3
For this project  i have created an online pizza ordering website.Users must sign in to view the menu after which they can place their order. Once their order is made,as a personal touch, the website will sent an email to their email confirming their order.
Admins can access the db through the inbuilt admin page.They also have the permisiion to view the order of the customer .Users cannot access this page as they dont have the required permission.
From the menu the Users ,after placing their order, is taken to the checkout from where they can order/confirm their items which then take you to the success page.
